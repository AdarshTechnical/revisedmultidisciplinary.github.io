	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">Indigo -By the thirteenth century Indian Indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy,France and Britain to dye clothes. However, only small amounts of Indigo reached european market and its price was very high. By the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent.</h2><br>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">As the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planter.</h2><br>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">Others - The policy of commercialization of agriculture by the British encouraged market oriented producÂ­tion of cash crops such as opium, tea, coffee, sugar, jute and indigo. Indian peasants were forced to grow these cash crops that spoiled the fertility of the land and no other crop could be grown on it.</h2><br><br>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">Silk - Hazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price.</h2><br>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">Cotton - By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment.English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods.But worse was still to come.By the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected specialists,spinners and thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless.</h2>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">This all impacted on the GDP of the country.</h2>	<br>
