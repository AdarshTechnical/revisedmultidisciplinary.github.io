<h1 style="font-family: 'Piazzolla', serif; text-align: center;padding: 10px;">Trader Became Ruler</h1>
<hr>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">The ability of the British government to raise taxes and loans  to support aggressive military policies by Hanoverian  governments, and the superiority of the Royal navy over other European navies,both played a large part in creating the condition through which trade and empire could flourish.As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696 it began building a fort around the settlement.It bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages.It also persuaded the mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. But did this continue firmly? </h2>
