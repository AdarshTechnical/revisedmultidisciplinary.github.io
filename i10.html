</h2><hr>
   <h3 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px; text-align: center;"> British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General.</h3> <br>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px; text-align: center;">The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. From 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts – a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors.  To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta. </h3>

</h2><hr>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px; text-align: center;">India now is a democratic country with balance administration. The present administration is divided into three organs - the Legislative, the Executive and the Judiciary - each depending on each other. The constitution provides Fundamental Rights to individual and provides separation of powers. </h3><br>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px; text-align: center;">India is a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic and Republic with a Parliamentary form of government. There is a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head to advice the President who is the constitutional head of the country. Similarly in states there is a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as its head, who advises the Governor. This section provides insight of Indian governance and administration at the Central, state as well as local level. </h3>
