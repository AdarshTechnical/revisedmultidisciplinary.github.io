  <hr>
  <h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">Freedom is a condition in which people have the opportunity to speak, act and pursue happiness without unnecessary external restrictions. Freedom is important because it leads to enhanced expressions of creativity and original thought, increased productivity, and an overall high quality of life.
 </h2><br>
  <h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">The idea of freedom is complex, and it must be redefined and defended anew by each generation. Moreover, the value of freedom can only be understood and appreciated by those who have a sense of the past and a highly developed understanding of human nature. All too often, people who live in freedom tend to ignore its fragility and take it for granted. Conversely, people who have not been raised within a long-standing tradition of freedom have trouble understanding and implementing it in their society.
