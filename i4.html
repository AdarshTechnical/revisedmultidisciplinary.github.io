	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">By the end of eighteenth century demands of indigo increased. The rytos(farmers) were reluctant to grow indigo as they were forced to sign a contract, and agreement(satta). Those who find the contract got cash advances the planters at low rates. The planters provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivator prepared the soil, sowed the seeds and looked after the crops.When the harvest of indigo was delivered to the planter a new loan was give to the ryot, and the cycles started all over a game.</h2><br>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">Peasants who were usually tempted by the loans soon realised that the price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle level ended.</h2>
	<hr>
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Graduate', cursive; padding-left:30px;">This eventually lead to the collapse of indigo production in bengal as ryot denied producing the indigo anymore. Protest started taking place by the peasants / ryots supported by the zamindars.Ryots refused to pay the rent to the planters, and attacked Indigo factories armed with sword and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned  up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements.Gomasthas the agents of planters who came to collect the rent were beaten up.The indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters.In 1859 Lieutenant Governor toured the regions seeing the conditions of ryots. After it  the Indigo Commission was constituted by the government which accepted the fault of the planters and asked them to stop the cultivation.Planters eventually moved out of the cities.
